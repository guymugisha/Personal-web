<h1>My Journey</h1>
<p>After completing high school with a focus on Mathematics, Physics, and Computer Science, you developed a strong foundation in analytical thinking and problem-solving. Your passion for technology and innovation led you to join ALX, where you started building practical skills in programming and technology, especially through hands-on projects that introduced you to AI, software development, and DevOps practices.</p>
<p>This experience deepened your curiosity and inspired you to pursue further education at African Leadership University (ALU), where you continued growing both technically and as a leader. At ALU, you’ve been aligning your mission — to inspire Rwandan youth in AI education — with your academic and professional journey, working to bridge the gap between technology and the next generation through mentorship, innovation, and purposeful learning.</p>
