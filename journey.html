    <h1>My Journey</h1>
    <p>After completing high school with a focus on Mathematics, Physics, and Computer Science.
        I developed a strong foundation in analytical thinking and problem-solving. 
        My passion for technology and innovation Me you to join ALX, where I started building practical skills in programming and technology, especially through hands-on projects that introduced you to AI, software development, and DevOps practices.</p>
    <p>This experience deepened my curiosity and inspired me to pursue further education at African Leadership University (ALU).
        where I continued growing both technically and as a leader. At ALU, I’ve been aligning your mission — to inspire Rwandan youth in AI education — with your academic and professional journey, working to bridge the gap between technology and the next generation through mentorship, innovation, and purposeful learning.</p>
